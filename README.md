QuickLook Adventure - iOS & macOS Application

Welcome to the File Type Guessing Game for iOS and macOS! This interactive application combines elements of a guessing game and a file browser. Users will test their knowledge of file types based on thumbnail previews and interact with files in a unique, engaging way.

Features

1. File Type Guessing Game

    •    The game begins with a series of draggable file thumbnails displayed at the top of the screen.
    •    Below those thumbnails are designated “drop zones” corresponding to different file types (e.g., image, audio, video, etc.).
    •    Objective: The user must examine each thumbnail and drag it to the correct file type drop zone.

2. Feedback on Correct and Incorrect Guesses

    •    Incorrect Guess: If the user drops a file thumbnail in an incorrect zone, the file returns to its original position, and the drop zone vibrates briefly to signal the mistake.
    •    Correct Guess: When a file thumbnail is correctly matched to its file type drop zone, it disappears from the game view.
    •    The game continues until all files are matched to their correct file types.

3. File Grid with QuickLook Preview

    •    After successfully completing the game, a file grid view appears, displaying a collection of files available in the application.
    •    File Selection: Users can click on any file in the grid to select it.
    •    QuickLook Preview: By pressing the space bar while files are selected, users can open a QuickLook preview for a closer examination of the file(s).

How to Play

    1.    Drag and Drop: Click and drag each file thumbnail from the top row and drop it into the matching file type zone below.
    2.    Observe Feedback: If the file returns to its original spot, it was an incorrect guess. If the file disappears, you guessed correctly.
    3.    View Files in Grid: Once all files are matched correctly, explore the displayed file grid.
    4.    QuickLook Preview: Select files in the grid and press space bar to activate a QuickLook preview.
